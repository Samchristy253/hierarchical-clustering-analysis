# Hierarchical Clustering in Machine Learning

This repository contains an in-depth exploration of **Hierarchical Clustering**, a popular unsupervised machine learning technique used for cluster analysis. The project demonstrates the implementation, visualization, and evaluation of hierarchical clustering on real-world datasets.

## 📌 Overview

Hierarchical clustering builds a multilevel hierarchy of clusters by either:
- **Agglomerative (Bottom-Up)**: Initially treats each observation as a single cluster and merges them iteratively.
- **Divisive (Top-Down)**: Starts with all observations in one cluster and splits them recursively.

The method produces a tree-like diagram called a **dendrogram**, which helps in visualizing the nested groupings.
